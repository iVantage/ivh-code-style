# ivh-code-style

This repository contains materials relating to style guidelines for iVantage
Health Analytics.

As a general note try to wrap your summaries and descriptions at **80 chars**.
This makes sure everything fits nicely in editor windows and also keeps things
reasonable regardless of where they are displayed.


## Coding Style

Examples of coding style can be found in `./examples`.


## DocBlock Conventions

The `./snippets` folder contains minimal examples for common spots in your code
you will want to use a DocBlock and some notes on why/how they should be used.
Feel free to use more DocBlock tags than prescribed as your situation calls for
but those used in the examples should be included.

When it isn't obvious we'll use mustache syntax to denote {{VARIABLES}} that
should be filled in by you or automatically generated by your editor.

Summaries and descriptions should be written as markdown.

Summaries should be clear and concise but need not be written in full sentences.
Descriptions should be written in full sentences.

For starters we'll work with the set of tags outlined
[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phpdoc).
